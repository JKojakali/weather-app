# weather-app

This is a weather app that will tell you the weather for the day and tomorrow using the OpenWeatherApi

# Features

### Get Weather for a city

When the app is first loaded you are given a list of five different cities. Clicking on it will then 
load and render a screen that shows you the current weather for the day and you are able to navigate
to tomorrow's weather by clicking on the tomorrow tab located at the top.

If the city you would like to look up is not located as one of the default options. You are then given
the option to search for your city at the bottom of the screen. Which will then show you the current 
weather for the day and give you the option to look at tomorrow's if chosen.
