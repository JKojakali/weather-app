So all together it is




# weather-app

This is a weather app that will tell you the weather for today and tomorrow using the OpenWeatherApi.

# Features

### Get Weather for a City

Search for a city in the search bar at the top or select one of the default cities in the list. Doing so will show you details about the weather for that specific city. Once on the detailed view you have the option to look at the weather for today or tomorrow.

# Set Up

You will first need to generate a new API key to gain access to the OpenWeatherApi. This can be done by
going to the link provided and following the steps to generate an API key.

```
https://openweathermap.org/api
```

Next, make sure you have XCode and a simulator installed. You will also need Expo to run the project.

To install Expo
```
1. In your terminal, run npm install -g expo-cli
```

Once the above is completed, do the following to run the application
 
```
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the project
3. Run npm install
4. Run expo start
```

# What I Would Have Liked to Get Done

Due to the recommended amount of time I should spend on the project being a couple of hours, there were a few things I didn't get to. Normally I would do the following

```
• Write tests
• Find better assets
• Spend more time on the UI/UX
• Add more functionality(7 day forecast, geolocation features etc.)
```
